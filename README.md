## Website URL: 

## Summary

This is a portfolio built from scratch in order to exhibit my HTML and CSS skills. Also as an on going website to show off my skills as I learne and grow through this bootcamp.

## HTML 

HTML: for this required a good amount of sectioning. Also anchors in order to make it Hyper-tectual and Able to link to the websites I have created and my contact info. I added a fun little elemnt  <sub> to the ordinals on my prject dates (something I picked up from my book HTML & CSS design and build websites by Jon Duckett). 

## CSS technique

Being my first ever website from scratch there was quite a bit of trial and error when it came to the CSS

Flexboxs: This was essential to make the website reactive to changes in browser sizes. It was difficult at first remebering to initate the display flex in the parent as well as the orientation properties of the child element in the box.

Pseudo-Code: I like the idea of highlighting certain interactive elemnet of the page, especially the hover: enlargment property I put in there (I found that out  through a quick google search on Css pseudo-code)
