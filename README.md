## Website URL: 

## Summary

This is a portfolio built from scratch in order to exhibit my HTML and CSS skills. Also as an on going website to show off my skills as I learne and grow through this bootcamp.

## HTML 

HTML: for this required a good amount of sectioning. Also anchors in order to make it Hyper-tectual and Able to link to the websites I have created and my contact info. I added a fun little elemnt  <sub> to the ordinals on my prject dates (something I picked up from my book HTML & CSS design and build websites by Jon Duckett). 

## CSS technique

Being my first ever website from scratch there was quite a bit of trial and error when it came to the CSS

Flexboxs: This was essential to make the website reactive to changes in browser sizes. It was difficult at first remembering to initiate the display flex in the parent element as well as the orientation properties of the child element in the box.

I wanted to add a feature that would send me an email when someone submitted the form, but I found out that I would need to add Javascript for that, so I'll have to update that feature later. 

Pseudo-Code: I like the idea of highlighting certain interactive elemnet of the page, especially the hover: enlargment property I put in there (I found that out  through a quick google search on Css pseudo-code)

Media Queries: At first I thought MQs auto overrid other elements but I found out that I had to address those directly in my CSS MQ code. Eventually I got them to work fairly well. 


## Interactive Part (sharable links = website in action)
